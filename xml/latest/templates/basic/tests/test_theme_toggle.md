<!-- Toggling the theme switch flips subject_theme_dark and restyles the screen.

     A test's <view> is built exactly like a component's, so it can `extends` a
     real screen and drive the actual UI. Steps run top to bottom; the first
     failing assertion fails the test.

		<!-- Pin every subject the assertions depend on instead of inheriting
		     whatever globals.xml currently defaults to — otherwise changing a

		     reference with an `_err` suffix so you can look at the difference. -->
