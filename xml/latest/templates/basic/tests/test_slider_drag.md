<!-- Dragging a slider writes its bound subject.

     Where test_theme_toggle.xml extends a real screen, this one builds a small
     view of its own — useful for exercising a single component without
     depending on where it happens to sit on a screen.

		     Give every pointer step a few ms of its own: move_to only updates the
		     input position, and LVGL needs a tick to read it. Pressing in the
		     same instant registers at the *previous* position, and the drag then
		     silently does nothing.

		     Releasing beyond the end clamps to max_value, so the assertion holds
		     without depending on knob width or pixel-perfect aim. Prefer clamped
		     endpoints over mid-track positions, which are brittle. -->
